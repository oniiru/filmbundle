		<h3>Every month, we partner with 5-7 filmmakers and 2 non-profits to bring a limited-time,
streamable bundle of <span style="font-weight:bold">amazing independent films </span>to consumers.</h3>


<h3 style="margin-bottom: 80px;
">The twist? <i>Customers choose how 
much they want to pay for it.</i> And to take it a step further, they choose 
how much of their payment goes to the films (including the individual 
filmmakers if they feel so inclined), to the charities, and even to us. We put all the control in the customers' capable hands.</h3>
<div class="purchase"><img src="click.png"></div><div class="popup"><img src="itgoeslikethis.png"></div>
<h3 style="margin-top:60px">While this model is new to the film industry, <span style="font-weight:800;color:black">it has been used 
very successfully in the independent video game space and has raised over 
$20M for game developers and $10M for charities in the last 2 years.</span></h3>
<h3>These numbers are all well and good, but you may be asking yourself one very common question...</h3>
<h2>What's to stop people from paying $.01 for my work??</h2>
<h3>Glad you asked! In short, they are free to do so, but if psychology tells us anything, most won't, and besides,
	 we've worked in several hooks to keep prices up. :-)</h3>

<h3 class="dude">Pay above average to unlock special content.</h3>
<h4 class="sweet">We reserve special features and at least one film for customers that pay above 
	the current average price. This encourages higher payments, provides a suggested value, and causes the average
	 to increase as the promotion goes on. </h4>

	<h3>Here are a few common ones, but if yours aren't answered below,<a href="mailto:andrew@filmbundle.com"> shoot me an email. </a></h3>
<h3 class="collapsible" id="section1">What about the rights to our films?</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="content">
        <p>We take absolutely no rights to the films and you are free to continue selling them via any avenue you wish. 
        	We aim simply to promote your work to a larger audience and help you get the money you deserve. 
        	We only require that films not be available online for free during or within 2 months of the promotion.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 class="collapsible" id="section2">How are the films distributed?</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="content">
        <p>Customers will be able to stream the films they've purchased by logging in to their secure FilmBundle account. 
        	Filmmakers can also choose to make their films available to 
        	download if they wish, but that is entirely up to the rights holder.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 class="collapsible" id="section3">How do I get paid?</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="content">
        <p>After the promotion ends, we will send you 100% of the payment designated to you minus the 2.8% credit
        	card transaction fee which is taken before we receive payment.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 class="collapsible" id="section4">How does promotion work?</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="content">
<p>We have direct contact with over a hundred bloggers and industry influencers large and small. With each bundle we coordinate a PR push to accompany its release. We promote the bundle by getting buzz around your film and you as a filmmaker. <br><br>

As experienced internet entrepreneurs we come from a background of SEO and SEM (search engine optimization and marketing), and have the ability to execute tactics that most filmmakers don't.<br><br>

We built the site from the ground up to encourage sharing of content. We make it extremely easy for customers to tell their friends about it. We know they'll love your work and won't be able to post it to twitter, facebook, pinterest and everywhere else they live online. <br><br>

Accompanying each launch, are several off-line events (mixer, panels, competitions) to build buzz and anticipation from our soon to be loyal following.<br><br>

We also rely on you as filmmakers and our non-profit partners to tell your fans about the bundle. That means that hopefully you will have the fan bases of 6 other filmmakers and 2 non-profits looking at your work.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3 class="collapsible" id="section5">Level with me, how much will I make per sale?</h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="content">
<p>
	Obviously this will vary from customer to customer, but it is true that while you can make substantial money by being in a bundle, in most cases you won't earn as much per sale as you would selling directly.
	Due to the flash sale nature of the bundles, we like to think of this as a promotion for the film and you as a filmmaker, rather than a long-term sales channel. <br><br>
	
	At the end of the day, we know what you really want is to have your work seen and appreciated, so think of it this way - would you rather have your work seen by 100 people at $10 each or 1000 people at $1 each?
